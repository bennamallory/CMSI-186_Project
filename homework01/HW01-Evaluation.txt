Evaluation for homework 01: Calendar Stuff and CountTheDays

CalendarStuff and CountTheDays program
Includes running CalendarStuffTester test program
Includes running automated CountTheDays program
=================================================

One of your isValidDate tests didn't pass --
   February 29, 2001 should NOT be a valid date.

Nice handling of the out of order dates, though!

There are compile errors in your CountTheDays.java program.  The
errors are all because you are "re-declaring" the parameters in the
method call to "CalendarStuff.daysBetween()".  I've made a copy and
fixed the offending lines so you can see the difference.  Check the
"CountTheDaysA.java" file.

Good work, Mallory!!
